Title of Project
Handwritten Digit Prediction - Classification Analysis

Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict handwritten digits.

Data Source
The dataset used for this project is the "digits" dataset from scikit-learn's built-in datasets. It contains images of handwritten digits, where each image is an 8x8 pixel matrix, and the target variable represents the actual digit value (0-9).

**Data Set Characteristics:**

    :Number of Instances: 1797
    :Number of Attributes: 64
    :Attribute Information: 8x8 image of integer pixels in the range 0..16.
    :Missing Attribute Values: None
    :Creator: E. Alpaydin (alpaydin '@' boun.edu.tr)
    :Date: July; 1998

This is a copy of the test set of the UCI ML hand-written digits datasets
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits

The data set contains images of hand-written digits: 10 classes where
each class refers to a digit.

Preprocessing programs made available by NIST were used to extract
normalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form. From a
total of 43 people, 30 contributed to the training set and different 13
to the test set. 32x32 bitmaps are divided into nonoverlapping blocks of
4x4 and the number of on pixels are counted in each block. This generates
an input matrix of 8x8 where each element is an integer in the range
0..16. This reduces dimensionality and gives invariance to small
distortions.

Data Visualization
# Visualize a few sample images from the dataset
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
for i in range(10):
    plt.subplot(2, 5, i + 1)
    plt.imshow(digits.images[i], cmap='gray')
    plt.title(f"Label: {digits.target[i]}")
    plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

Data Preprocessing
# Flatten the 8x8 images into a 1D array for feature variables
X = digits.data

# Normalize feature variables
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Define the target variable (y)
y = digits.target
Train Test Split
# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Modeling
# Initialize the logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Train the model on the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
LogisticRegression()

Model Evaluation
# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)

# Generate confusion matrix and classification report
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
class_report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(conf_matrix)
print("Classification Report:")

Prediction
from PIL import Image

# Load the image and convert it to grayscale
image = Image.open('download.png').convert('L')

# Resize the image to 8x8 pixels (the same size as the dataset images)
image = image.resize((8, 8))

# Convert the image to a numpy array
new_image = np.array(image)

# Flatten the 8x8 image into a 1D array for prediction
new_image_flattened = new_image.flatten().reshape(1, -1)

# Scale the feature variables using the previously defined scaler
new_image_scaled = scaler.transform(new_image_flattened)

# Make a prediction using the model
predicted_digit = model.predict(new_image_scaled)

print("Predicted Digit:", predicted_digit[0])
Predicted Digit: 4
